config EXT_MEM
	int "External memory"
	help
	  If you connected external memory to your AVR core,
	  enter the amount of bytes you connected here.

config STACK_SIZE
	int "Stack size"
	help
	  Enter the amount of bytes which should be
	  reserved for the stack by default. This value
	  will be the size of the main thread (if scheduling
	  is enabled) and it will be used as default for
	  other threads if no stack size is given when a new
	  thread is created.

config FCPU
	int "CPU frequency"
	default 8000000
	help
	  Enter the frequency your CPU will be running on here.

config SIMUL_AVR
	bool "Enable SIMULAVR support"
	select VFS
	help
	  By saying 'Y' here you will enable support for SIMUALAVR;
	  an AVR emulator. This will also enable two extra I/O
	  registers for input and output. All in- and output from the
	  std C library will be directed from and to these to I/O ports.
	  If unsure, say 'N' here.

choice
	prompt "STDIO output device"
	depends on STDIO
	help
	  Select which device driver should be used to drive
	  the STDIO library. By default the USART is selected.

config STDIO_SIMUL_AVR
	bool "STDIO simulavr driver"
	depends on SIMUL_AVR
	help
	  Select if you want to use the special output registers
	  of simulavr to drive the STDIO library.

config STDIO_USART
	bool "STDIO USART driver"
	depends on USART
	help
	  Select if you want to use the USART registers
	  to drive the STDIO library. If unsure say 'y' here.

config LIBFLT
	tristate "Floating point library"
	depends on m
	default m
	help
	  By saying 'm' here you enable the floating point
	  built-in library. You should only say 'm' here if
	  gcc is not build with soft-fp (which isn't the case
	  by default). If you unsure say 'm' here.

choice
	prompt "AVR core selection"
	help
	  Select the AVR architecture to build for.

config ATMEGA328
	bool "ATmega 328(p)"
	select ARCH_CLEAR_BIT
	select ARCH_TNC
	select ARCH_TNS
	select ARCH_SET_BIT
	help
	  Select if you are building for the Atmel ATmega328 or ATmega328p
	  AVR core.
endchoice

config PICO_POWER
	bool "Pico power"
	depends on ATMEGA328
	help
	  Select if you are building for the pico power variant
	  of your CPU. Do not select this option of you are not
	  planning to run on a pico power CPU.

config ATMEGA328_VECTORS
	int "ATmega328 vectors"
	depends on ATMEGA328
	default 26
	help
	  Set the amount of available vectors.
