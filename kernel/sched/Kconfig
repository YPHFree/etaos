	bool "Scheduler"
	depends on CRT
	select TIMER
	select SYS_TICK
	help
	  Say 'y' here if you want to enable the scheduler. The
	  scheduler is responsible for handeling the execution of
	  threads, virtual timers and, if available, SMP processors.
	  If you are unsure say 'n' here.

	bool

config EVENT_MUTEX
	bool "Event mutexes"
	select THREAD_QUEUE
	help
	  Enable to build more efficient mutexes, using
	  the scheduler to queue threads in a mutex. After
	  a signal has been given (from either IRQ or non-IRQ
	  context) the thread will be released into the run queue
	  again. If unsure say 'y' here.

config IPM
	bool "Inter-Process Messages"
	depends on EVENT_MUTEX
	help
	  Build support for IPM (Inter-Process Messages) if you say
	  'y' here. IPM can be used to communicate between different
	  threads which might also be running on another CPU.

config EXTENDED_THREAD
	bool "Extended thread API"
	depends on EVENT_MUTEX
	help
	  Say 'y' here to build the extended thread API.

config SCHED_DBG
	bool "Scheduling DBG"
	help
	  Say 'y' here to enable the scheduling debugger. This
	  function is only useful for ETAO/OS developers. If you
	  are unsure say 'n' here.
