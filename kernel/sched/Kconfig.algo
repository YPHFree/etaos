config EDF
	bool "(Virtual) Earliest Deadline First"
	select RR_SHARED
	select RR_ENTITY
	help
	  Say 'y' here to build the Earliest Deadline First algorithm.

config RR
	bool "Round robin scheduler"
	select RR_SHARED
	select RR_ENTITY
	help
	  Say 'y' here to use the round robin algorithm to
	  schedule different threads.

config FIFO
	bool "FIFO scheduler"
	select RR_SHARED
	select RR_ENTITY
	help
	  Say 'y' here to use the FIFO scheduling algorithm to
	  schedule threads. The FIFO scheduler does not take
	  priorities into account when scheduling new threads.
	  The queue's are sorted with the time of insertion used
	  as the sorting key.

config LOTTERY
	bool "Lottery scheduler"
	select RR_SHARED
	select RR_ENTITY
	help
	  Say 'y'here to build the lottery scheduler. The lottery
	  scheduler depends on random number generation to pick
	  threads in a 'fair' way.

	prompt "Default algorithm"
	help
	  Select the default scheduling policy.

config EDF_LOOKUP_TABLE
	bool "Priority ratio lookup table"
	default n
	depends on EDF
	help
	  Say 'y' here to use a look up table instead of a function
	  to convert a priority into a priority ratio. Doing so will
	  improve throughput on systems with a busy scheduler.
