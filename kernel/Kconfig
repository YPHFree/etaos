	help
	  Say 'y' here to use the traditional mutex 
	  locking mechanism.
	  This mechanism is a bit more sensitive to
	  deadlocks then the event queue mechanism.

config MUTEX_EVENT_QUEUE
	bool "Event queue mutex"
	depends on EVENT_MUTEX
	help
	  Say 'y' if you are interrested in using
	  event queue's as the backend for mutex
	  locks. These mechanism provides better
	  use of the CPU time, by using the scheduler
	  to run other threads when waiting for a lock.
	  The downside is, that the memory usage is
	  slightly higher and a bit more overhead when
	  locking/unlocking.
