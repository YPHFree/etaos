/**
 * @defgroup kernel ETA/OS kernel
 * @brief ETA/OS kernel API
 *
 * The kernel API supports the following features:
 *     - Scheduling/Multithreading
 *     - IRQ management
 *     - Memory management
 *     - I/O drivers
 *     - Timer management
 */

/**
 * @defgroup archAPI Architecture API
 * @brief API to access the architecture of the system.
 *
 * All architectures have to implement atleast this API to compile
 * the rest of ETA/OS succesfully.
 */

/* ================ Scheduler support ================ */

/**
 * @defgroup thread Thread management
 * @ingroup kernel
 * @brief Cooperative multi-threading support.
 * 
 * Typically ETA/OS is at its most useful where there are several concurrent 
 * tasks that need to be undertaken at the same time. To support this 
 * requirement, ETA/OS offers some kind of light processes called threads. 
 * In this context a thread is a sequence of executing software that can be
 * considered to be logically independent from other software that is running 
 * on the same CPU.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup sched Scheduling core
 * @ingroup kernel
 * @brief ETA/OS scheduling support.
 *
 * The scheduler is responsible for handling the available CPU time, and
 * distributing it around the available threads.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup preempt Preemption
 * @ingroup sched
 * @brief Preemption API
 *
 * API to manage the CPU preemption.

 */

/* ================ Timer support ================ */

/**
 * @defgroup tm Timer management
 * @ingroup kernel
 * @brief Asynchronous timer support.
 *
 * The timer management provides functions to start and stop asynchronous 
 * timers, determine the CPU speed and let a thread give up the CPU for a 
 * specified time period.
 */

/* ================ IRQ support ================ */

/**
 * @defgroup irq IRQ management
 * @ingroup kernel
 * @brief Interrupt support.
 *
 * Support to register interrupt handlers to the kernel. They can be registered
 * either as tradition IRQ handlers or as threaded IRQ's. Please note that
 * threaded IRQ's are slower.
 *
 * @note Note, that it is not required to register interrupts with Nut/OS. 
 *       Actually, this will route interrupts through the kernel, which 
 *       results in performance degradation.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup irqchip IRQ chip management
 * @ingroup irq
 * @brief IRQ chip support.
 *
 * IRQ chips are the chips responsible for generating IRQ's. Examples of IRQ
 * chips are the CPU and on an x86 system the IOAPIC. IRQ's are registered
 * on an IRQ chip when they are allocated using the ETA/OS IRQ API. When an
 * interrupt is triggered, the IRQ chip is responsible for handling the
 * interrupt.
 */

/* ================ Memory management ================ */

/**
 * @defgroup mm Memory management
 * @ingroup kernel
 * @brief Dynamic memory management.
 *
 * Dynamic memory allocations are made from the heap. The heap is a global 
 * resource containing all of the free memory in the system. The heap is 
 * handled in data structure of unused blocks of memory, the so called 
 * free-list.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup ff First fit allocator
 * @ingroup mm
 * @brief First fit memeory allocation algorithm.
 * 
 * The first fit allocator is the most simple allocator out there. It maintains
 * a list of available memory and removes an entry whenever it gets allocated.
 * If a memeory region gets free'd up, the region is added back into the list
 * of available memory.
 */

/* ================ LibC ================ */

/**
 * @defgroup libc C runtime library
 * @brief C run time library
 * @note When linking your application, pass -lc as the last library to your
 *       linker.
 *
 * Complementary runtime C library. Normal C libraries (like glibc) are way
 * to big to fit into small chips. This is a copy of a very compact c library.
 */

/* ================ Device drivers ================ */

/**
 * @defgroup dev Device drivers
 * @brief Standard device I/O functions.
 *
 * Device drivers are typically not accessed directly by an application. 
 * Instead they are used by the standard C library to perform data I/O.
 */

/**
 * @defgroup dev-core  Device core
 * @ingroup dev
 * @brief Device driver core.

 * drivers. Registering, and unregistering them for example.

 * @ingroup dev
 * @brief USART device core.
 *
 * A universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter, abbreviated UART, is a 
 * piece of computer hardware that translates data between parallel and serial 
 * forms. UARTs are commonly used in conjunction with communication standards 
 * such as EIA, RS-232, RS-422 or RS-485. The universal designation indicates 
 * that the data format and transmission speeds are configurable.
