 * @brief Dynamic memory management.
 *
 * Dynamic memory allocations are made from the heap. The heap is a global 
 * resource containing all of the free memory in the system. The heap is 
 * handled in data structure of unused blocks of memory, the so called 
 * free-list.

/**

 * @brief First fit memeory allocation algorithm.
 * 
 * The first fit allocator is the most simple allocator out there. It maintains
 * a list of available memory and removes an entry whenever it gets allocated.
 * If a memeory region gets free'd up, the region is added back into the list
 * of available memory.

/**
 * @defgroup bf Best fit allocator
 * @ingroup mm
 * @brief Best fit memeory allocation algorithm.
 * 
 * The best fit allocator is a variant to the first-fit algorithm. It is
 * slightly slower, but spills less memory and therefore reduces the amount of
 * fragmentation. It maintains a list of available memory and removes an entry 
 * whenever it gets allocated. However, in contrast to first-fit, best-fit will
 * search the entire free-list to find the best fitting block for the
 * allocation.
 * If a memeory region gets free'd up, the region is added back into the list
 * of available memory.
