 * @brief Dynamic memory management.
 *
 * Dynamic memory allocations are made from the heap. The heap is a global 
 * resource containing all of the free memory in the system. The heap is 
 * handled in data structure of unused blocks of memory, the so called 
 * free-list.

 * @brief First fit memeory allocation algorithm.
 * 
 * The first fit allocator is the most simple allocator out there. It maintains
 * a list of available memory and removes an entry whenever it gets allocated.
 * If a memeory region gets free'd up, the region is added back into the list
 * of available memory.
