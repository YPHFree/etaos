 * @brief Interrupt support.
 *
 * Support to register interrupt handlers to the kernel. They can be registered
 * either as tradition IRQ handlers or as threaded IRQ's. Please note that
 * threaded IRQ's are slower.
 *
 * @note Note, that it is not required to register interrupts with Nut/OS. 
 *       Actually, this will route interrupts through the kernel, which 
 *       results in performance degradation.

/**
 * @defgroup irqchip IRQ chip management
 * @ingroup irq
 * @brief IRQ chip support.
 *
 * IRQ chips are the chips responsible for generating IRQ's. Examples of IRQ
 * chips are the CPU and on an x86 system the IOAPIC. IRQ's are registered
 * on an IRQ chip when they are allocated using the ETA/OS IRQ API. When an
 * interrupt is triggered, the IRQ chip is responsible for handling the
 * interrupt.
