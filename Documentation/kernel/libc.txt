 * @ingroup libc
 * @brief Standard I/O interface.
 *
 * Please note that, in contrast to the standard, the NUT/OS file buffers
 * (i.e. streams), do not maintain any buffers. All input and or output is
 * directly handled by the underlaying device drivers.
 *
 * The standard streams (stdin, stdout and stderr) are redirected at application
 * start by ETA/OS, as per configuration.
