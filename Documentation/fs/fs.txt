 * @ingroup fs
 * @brief Simple read-only ROM file system.
 *
 * The ROMFS is a non-volatile read-only filesystem saved on in program
 * memory on harvard achitectures. Files in the ROMFS are built into the
 * application binary during compile time by the crurom tool.
 *
 * To include one or more files in the binary place them in one or more
 * seperate directory's in the directory of your application. Then add
 * the following lines to your application's Kbuild file:
 *
   @code
   crurom-y   := dir1 dir2 .. dirN
   crurom-obj := romfs.o
   @endcode
 * The files generated by the romfs driver can then be accessed as any other
 * using ETA/OS's crt (open, close, read, write, etc..).
