 * @brief USART device core.
 * 
 * @section usart-gen Generic description
 * A universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter, abbreviated UART, is a 
 * piece of computer hardware that translates data between parallel and serial 
 * forms. UARTs are commonly used in conjunction with communication standards 
 * such as EIA, RS-232, RS-422 or RS-485. The universal designation indicates 
 * that the data format and transmission speeds are configurable.
 *
 * @section usart-usage Usage
 * Writing or reading from a usart device is done as following:
 * @code{.c}
   int fd = open("dev-name", _FDEV_SETUP_RW);
   if(fd < 0)
   	error();
   write(fd, buff, length);
   read(fd, rxbuff, rxlen);
   close(fd);
   @endcode
